In this section, you will learn how to create a collection and/or community within VisCom.

# Collection

A collection is a setting where a user or team can group a set of visualizations to be viewed together. For example, a user may want to group a cohort of visualizations by data type or disease. 

The collection will display as shown [here](https://viz.stjude.cloud/st-jude-cloud-demo/collection/proteinpaint-and-genomepaint-examples~7). A collection can remain public, private, or private but with a direct link. 

This can be a way to share visualizations in bulk by using our direct link setting, if all visualizations remain private. Or, this is a way to share a collection of visualizations publicly for a direct purpose. 

Please email [support@stjude.cloud](support@stjude.cloud) with the list of visualizations you want grouped into a collection, including a description for the landing page. If they are private, a direct link will be given to share with others or for individual use. All visualizations must go through our internal approval process before the collection can be made public.

# Community

A community is a platform within VisCom that allows teams (and/or multiple users) to share visualizations related to the same research. 

For example, [Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI) - Retina](https://viz.stjude.cloud/community/audacious-goals-initiative-agi-retina~2) provides a platform about retinal diseases that highlight studies and research across multiple labs. Not only are the labs studies showcased, but the data supporting the visualizations are accessible. 

This platform can be empowering to share data, showcase visualizations, and propel discoveries. All communities have a logo and description that is tailored for that community’s initiative. 

Please email [support@stjude.cloud](support@stjude.cloud) that you are interested in creating a community. Our admin team will respond with the next steps. In general, we will want to set up an interview to understand your research and how you develop your data. Then, we will begin to roadmap the project so that we can get your branding (logo, description, and necessary data) completed. We will need access to your studies (publications, abstracts, etc) and then our team will work on how to get your visualizations in VisCom by providing one-on-one assistance, including a demonstration so that you can also develop visualizations on your own.
